## Introduction 

This report examines the Gini Index, a vital measure of income inequality, across all 52 U.S. states, as documented by Farris (2010). Our analysis investigates two significant historical periods: the era of the Great Depression and World War II (WWII) (1928 - 1945) and the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (2007 -- 2015). The report's objective is to understand how these historical events influenced income inequality trends among the states. The first section includes data cleaning, summarising, and data visualisation. The second part focuses on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the primary dimensionality reduction method, with the addition of cluster analysis and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).

## What we found...

Our analysis of income inequality during the Great Depression, WWII, and the GFC revealed significant findings:

**The Great Depression/WWII**

-   A five-cluster approach effectively groups states for detailed analysis.

-   States closer to the center in our MDS analysis show lower income inequality during these periods.

-   PC1 reflects higher GDP and lower unemployment, indicating recovery from the Great Depression.

-   PC2 strongly correlates with economic conditions during these events.

**The Global Financial Crisis (GFC)**

-   A five-cluster solution is again useful for meaningful groupings.

-   States shifted away from the center in our MDS analysis, indicating increased income inequality overall compared to the previous era.

-   PC1 aligns with the GFC recovery period (2009--2015), while PC2 relates to the GFC itself (2007 - 2008), reflecting changes in the GDP.

In summary, our analysis provided valuable insights into income inequality during critical historical events. To enhance our understanding, we recommend incorporating Factor Models and additional economic indicators. This will help us better interpret the complex economic dynamics shaped by these significant events.
